# Tribler REST API

## Overview
The Tribler REST API allows you to create your own applications with the channels, torrents and other data that can be found in Tribler. Moreover, you can control Tribler and add data to Tribler using various endpoints. This documentation explains the format and structure of the endpoints that can be found in this API. *Note that this API is currently under development and more endpoints will be added over time*.

## Making requests
The API has been built using [Twisted Web](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWeb). Requests go over HTTP where GET requests should be used when data is fetched from the Tribler core and POST requests should be used if data in the core is manipulated (such as adding a torrent or removing a download). Responses of the requests are in JSON format.
